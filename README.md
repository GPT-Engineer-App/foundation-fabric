# Bare-Bones Web Application

This is a minimal web application setup with basic HTML structure, simple CSS for styling, and a basic JavaScript setup. Use this as a starting point to build your features.

## Instructions

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

### Modifying the Application

- The main entry point of the application is `src/pages/Index.jsx`.
- You can add new components in the `src/components` directory and import them into `Index.jsx`.
- Styling is done using Tailwind CSS. You can modify the styles in `src/index.css`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist` directory.

### Linting

To lint the code, run:
```bash
npm run lint
```
